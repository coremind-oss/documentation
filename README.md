# documentation
All the documentation we need for our projects

All the questions and discussions will have to go trough this repo.

All new branches should be named by following this naming convention: 
  Issue-X
Optionally use Issue-X-Name, where X means issue number in Github and Name is the assignee who is working on that issue.
